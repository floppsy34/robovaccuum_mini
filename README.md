# robovaccuum_mini
## Project Motivation
I'm attempting to make a mini robovac army because:
- It made my friends laugh when I threatened to do it.
- I'm (at the time of starting this project) a graduate mechatronics engineer and I want to practice and hone in on my passion to develop embedded systems. This includes firmare, software and electronics design as well as project documentation and note-taking.
- I've found it difficult to start a robotics project I am passionate about because my interest lies in the firmware, RT/OS and electronics development and not the "robot" itself. However, the increasing responsibilities in my life have meant I need to be more efficient with my time, and as someone cerebral palsy, cleaning my house represents a massive amount of stress that could be better managed.
